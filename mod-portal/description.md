# Staged Blueprint Planning

The ultimate mod for designing staged blueprints, e.g. for 100% speedruns. AKA the anti-anti-anti-tool.

Separate your builds into stages. Edit entities in any stage, and changes will automatically be applied to all later stages. Create a blueprint book of all stages in one click.

This mod is in active development (new features are still being added!) Feedback is greatly appreciated.

## Basic usage

Create a new staged build by clicking the "â‹®" button in the window on the top.

In the "Current Staged Build" window, you can see/change the stage you are currently in, and can also open the stage settings.

When you make a change, that change will be applied to the current and _later_ stages (with some exceptions, see below).
Every game interaction should be handled. (If this is not the case, please submit a bug report!)

You can automatically create blueprints/a blueprint book the build in the settings window.

Opening an entity's gui will show an "Stage info" window on the right, with more info/actions on a specific entity.

See below for full details on interactions.

Use the navigation controls! These are (with default keybindings):

- `[CTRL+Mouse wheel]` to move between stages
- `[CTRL+Middle mouse button]` to cycle between notable stages of the hovered entity (where the entity is different from the previous stage)
- `[CTRL+SHIFT+Middle mouse button]` to teleport to the first stage of the hovered entity (or preview)
- `[CTRL+ALT+Middle mouse button]` to move an entity to the current stage

You can turn on cyclic stage navigation using a per-player setting.

## Full details

### Editing

Building, mining, rotating, fast-replacing, copper/circuit wires, configuration changing, blueprints/deconstruction planner/upgrade planner, moving entities with [Picker Dollies](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PickerDollies), are all supported. If there is some interaction that is not handled, please submit a bug report!

Deleting or rotating an entity is only allowed in the _first stage_ (as those changes cannot be blueprinted between stages).

Trains are treated specially; they are only present in one stage (as you usually do not re-paste trains).
Trains can move from their original position, use the entity stage info gui to reset or update their position.

Preview entities (map-view-like outlines) will be shown for each entity in lower stages. If in editor mode, you can open them to view the entity stage info gui.

If an entity cannot be created in any stage for any reason, an error indicator will be shown at all stages.

### Stage move tool

In the bottom right (shortcuts menu), you can access the stage move tool.

Use (default keybinding) `Shift + Scroll wheel` to change the target stage.

- Selecting entities will move entities in the _current_ stage to the target stage.
- Alt/Reverse selecting with the tool will move entities from _any_ stage to the current stage.

### Changes between stages

Changing the configuration of an entity between stages is supported. When this is done, the entity will be highlighted in blue, and a blueprint sprite indicator will appear in all lower stages.
Similarly, by using the _upgrade planner_ (not fast-replace), entities can be upgraded. A green highlight and upgrade planner sprite will appear in all lower stages.

Copper/circuit wire changes _between_ stages are not supported. Instead, they are always present in all stages.

This is not relevant to trains, as they only appear in one stage.

### Landfill/tiles

Landfill/lab tiles can be automatically placed in your blueprints. See the Staged build settings gui for more info.

As of now, this is the only way tiles are supported.

Additionally, the "Flexible Offshore Pump Placement" startup setting enables placing offshore pumps in places not usually allowed. This may be useful in designing blueprints with offshore pumps, and is enabled by default.

### Blueprints

Using the "Get Blueprint" button in the Stage settings gui will create a blueprint of the current stage. In the "Blueprints" tab, the "Make Blueprint Book" button will create a blueprint book of all staged.

The Blueprints tab also has more options for creating blueprints, such as synchronizing grid-size settings, including the next stage's tiles in each blueprint (useful for landfill).

### Accidental data loss prevention

If an entity with stage changes is deleted, a "settings remnant" is left behind (white outline). If you undo the deletion, those settings will be restored. This is so you don't lose data if you accidentally deleted it.
To remove settings remnants, use the `Staged Build Cleanup Tool` (shortcut, in the bottom right).

### Footgun removal

If an entity overlaps with another in a higher stage, a red outline will appear where the entity should be, and a warning indicator will appear in all other stages. Use the `Staged Build Cleanup Tool` to attempt to replace these.

Rotating/upgrading an underground will also affect its paired underground, in any stage.

It is not possible to upgrade an underground if that will change which underground it pairs with (breaking belt weaving, etc.). If this is intentional, mine and replace the underground.

Due to limitations in implementation, if an underground can possibly connect with multiple other undergrounds (e.g. an underground "cuts" another underground), it cannot be rotated/upgraded _after_ being built.

### Cleanup tool

Using the build cleanup tool will remove "settings remnants", and attempt to revive any errored entities.

Reverse-selecting using the cleanup tool will **force-delete** errored entities.
