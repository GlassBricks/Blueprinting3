Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2022-08-31
  Changes:
    - Each stage is now on its own separate layer; Assembly creation has been simplified.
    - The above change is backwards incompatible. Migrating will remove all assemblies, entities will still be kept.
    - Assembly settings gui will now always match the player position
    - Other Assembly settings gui improvements
    - Tweaked navigation UI
